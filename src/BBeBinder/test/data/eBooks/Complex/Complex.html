    <h2>
        Justifications</h2>
    <h3>
        Centered Text</h3>
    <p>
        The next line is centered with a paragraph style:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
        This is centered</p>
    <p>
        And this text with the &lt;center&gt; tag:</p>

        This is centered</center>
    <h3>
        Right Justified Text</h3>
    <p>
        This is some left justified text:</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
        “At the same time,” he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at
        his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly be open to a charge
        of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest
        yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all.
        The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular
        experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the
        twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
        outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you may
        have bordered on the trivial.”</p>
    <h3>
        Fully Justified Text</h3>
    <p>
        This is some fully justified text:</p>

    <h3>
        Block Quote</h3>
    <p>
        Left Margin</p>
    <blockquote>
        This is block quoted text that should be indented a little bit from the left side
        of the page. Usually this is about 0.5", but should probably be less on the Sony
        reader.

    <h2>
        Long Chapter</h2>
    <p>
        <a name="LongChapter"></a><font size="+2">&#8220;T</font>o the man who loves art
        for its own sake,&#8221; remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement
        sheet of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, &#8220;it is frequently in its least important
        and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant
        to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these
        little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am
        bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to
        the many <i>causes célèbres</i> and sensational trials in which I have figured but
        rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have
        given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have
        made my special province.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8220;And yet,&#8221; said I, smiling, &#8220;I cannot quite hold myself absolved
        from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8220;You have erred, perhaps,&#8221; he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with
        the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace
        his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood&#8212;&#8220;you
        have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements
        instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning
        from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8220;It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,&#8221; I
        remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more
        than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend&#8217;s singular character.</p>
    <p>
        &#8220;No, it is not selfishness or conceit,&#8221; said he, answering, as was his
        wont, my thoughts rather than my words. &#8220;If I claim full justice for my art,
        it is because it is an impersonal thing&#8212;a thing beyond myself. Crime is common.
        Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you
        should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into
        a series of tales.&#8221;</p>
    <p>
        It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either
        side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between
        the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless
        blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth
        and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock
        Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement
        columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his
        search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8220;At the same time,&#8221; he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat
        puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, &#8220;you can hardly be
        open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so
        kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its
        legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of
        Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected
        with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were
        all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,
        I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.&#8221;</p>
