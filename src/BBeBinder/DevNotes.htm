    <h2>
        Design Principles and Goals</h2>
    <p>
        This project is moving closer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC
            paradigm</a>. The View (UI) is definately separated from the Model and Control
        elements. So if you find you're modifying the LRF data in the BBeBinder project
        then you are probably working in the wrong assembly, and may need to be in BBeBLib.
        BBeBLib is just a class library that does no UI at all.</p>
    <p>
        BBeBinder should be the only assembly that does anything Microsoft specific - it
        has to because it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSHTML">MSHTML</a>.
        The hope is that the other .Net programs can be run under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29">
            Mono</a> on other operating systems. Plug-ins are free to do whatever they want
        in this regard.</p>
    <h3>
        Testing</h3>
    <p>
        We will be introducing unit tests fairly soon using NUnit. At the moment there is
        one high level test (described below).</p>
    <h2>
        Required Development Tools</h2>
    <p>
        BBeB Binder is a Microsoft .Net 2.0 program. It is developed with Visual Studio
        2005. At a minimum you will need VS2005.</p>
    <p>
        You can manually build the solution, but to do a full build you will also need the
        <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/">MSBuild Community Tasks</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        Building BBeB Binder</h2>
    <p>
        To manually build the solution open up src\BBeBinder.sln and building it in VS2005.</p>
    <p>
        To fully build this project you will need to do a command line build via MSBuild
        as follows:</p>
    <div class="code">
        & msbuild</div>
    <p>
        msbuild is part of .Net 2.0, and is currently located at C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\MSBuild.exe.</p>
    <p>
        To create the release distribution (The ZIP file that contains the setup) then do
        the following:</p>
    <div class="code">
        & msbuild /t:dist</div>
    <h2>
        Running Tests</h2>
    <p>
        BBeB Binder is still short on tests, but it does have one test where it converts
        HelloWorld.txt into HelloWorld.lrf, and compares it (byte-for-byte) with a previously
        created golden master. If the files differ at all then the test fails. This test
        is run as part of a normal command-line build and if it fails then the build will
        also fail.</p>
    <p>
        This is actually a very good test, and it's prevented a whole lot of bugs being
        introduced during the course of development and refactoring. However, from time
        to time a change will be made that legitimately changes the LRF output format. When
        this occurs the right thing to do is to update the golden master. Take care to ensure
        that your new golden master is <em>really</em> correct before doing this.</p>
    <h2>
        Changing Versions</h2>
    <p>
        The Version.txt file at the top level of the project contains the version number
        that is substituted into every project. The "update-versions" target in BBeBinder.proj
        makes this substitution. This works for all files with the exception of changing
        the installer version in BBeBinderSetup.vdproj. There is an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bbebinder/issues/detail?id=5&can=2&q=">
            open issue</a> on this, but until it is resolved this needs to be done manually.</p>
    <h2>
        Before Committing Changes</h2>
    <p>
        So you've done some work on the code and you want to commit your changes. If you
        are not a project developer then please submit a patch to one. If you <em>are</em>
        a project developer then please do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your source is up to date.</li>
        <li>Run msbuild /t:clean</li>
        <li>Run msbuild /t:dist</li>
        <li>Convert Complex.html to a LRF and look at that LRF in the Sony CONNECT Reader desktop
            application.</li>
        <li>Convert moby10b.txt to a LRF and look at that LRF in the Sony CONNECT Reader desktop
            application.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Taking these steps will help ensure that you don't introduce new bugs into the code.</p>
