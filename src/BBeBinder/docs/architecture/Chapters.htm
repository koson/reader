    <h2>
        Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This document describes the process by which BBeB Binder creates chapters in the
        eBooks that it creates.</p>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    <p>
        BBeB Binder will automatically create chapters in the BBeB eBooks that it creates.
        BBeB Binder uses the HTML DOM as the common interchange data format. This means
        that all of the file import plugins create an HTML stream, which is in turn loaded
        into a MSHTML control (i.e. WebBrowser). The WebBrowser's HTML DOM is then traversed
        to create the BBeB file. What this means is that the HTML-&gt;BBeB conversion process
        only has the information in the DOM at its disposal.</p>
    <h2>
        Chapter Creation</h2>
    <p>
        Creating chapters must be easy - ideally it will be automatic. BBeB Binder will
        automatically convert the heading HTML styles (i.e. H1, H2, H3, ... H6) to chapters.
        It won't convert all six heading styles because this will usually product more chapters
        than the user generally wants. There are two patterns that I have noticed in most
        novels, I'll call them: book/part/chapter and book/chapter.</p>
    <p>
        book/part/chapter is where a book is first divided into two or more parts (sometimes
        these are called books), and these parts are in turn called chapters. In this case
        we generally want to see both the parts and chapters start on new pages.</p>
    <p>
        book/chapter is what I would call the traditional book layout style with each chapter
        starting on a new page.</p>
    <p>
        So let's examine an HTML document with this structure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One (h1)
        <ul><li>alpha (h2)</li>
            <li>bravo (h2)</li>
            <ul><li>omega (h3)</li></ul>
            <li>charlie (h2)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Two (h1)
        <ul><li>delta (h2)</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Three (h1)</li>
        <li>Four (h1)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using book/part/chapters the parts would be "One", "Two", "Three", and "Four", and
        the chapters would be all the h2 level items. But let's say that it didn't make
        sense to do it this way and instead the person doing the conversion really wants
        book/chapter. They must have a way of specifying the layout style.</p>
    <p>
        Instead of trying to classify all of the different layout styles that books might
        be laid out in we will provide a single control that allows the user to specify
        what heading level will get new pages. The default will be H2 so H1 and H2 will
        start on new pages, and H3 through H6 will not.</p>
    <h3>
        Special Heading</h3>
    <p>
        Many HTML documents use H1 for the document title, and then start at H2 for the
        next heading style - using H2-H6 throughout the document. In fact <em>this</em>
        document does exactly that. If we did consider the first H1 element then we would
        likely not be producing the chapters that the user wants.</p>
    <p>
        Solution: The user needs to delete the H1 style at the start of the document.</p>
    <h3>
        Not starting at H1</h3>
    <p>
        Many authors don't understand CSS well, and because the default heading fonts are
        so big they don't start with H1, or even H2's. Their HTML document is only populated
        by H3's and higher.</p>
    <p>
        Solution: Scan the document for the lowest heading and default the chapter heading
        filter to be one greater than the minimum found.</p>
    <h2>
        Chapter Formatting</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to starting a chapter on a new page it is definately more aesthetic
        if it has some sort of style applied to it. Increasing the font size as in this
        sample:</p>
    <div align="center">
        <img border="1" src="img/chapter-foundation.gif" alt="Second Foundation chapter heading" /><br />
        Exerpt from Isaac Asimov's "Second Foundation"</div>
        <p>Here's an example of a section that doesn't start a new chapter, but will still
            be called out in some way. This would be an example of a H3 element where the chapter
            filter was set to H2 (i.e. only H1's and H2's got a new page).</p>
    <div align="center">
        <img border="1" src="img/chapter-mideast.gif" alt="The Complete Guide to Middle East Conflict chapter heading" /><br />
        Exerpt from Mitchell G. Bard's "The Complete Guide to Middle East Conflict"</div>
        <p>Here's an even more complicated chapter beginning with lines, an image, and font
            size/color specification:</p>
    <div align="center">
        <img border="1" src="img/chapter-restaurant.gif" alt="The Complete Guide to Middle East Conflict chapter heading" /><br />
        Exerpt from Douglas Adam's "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"</div>
    <br />
    The plan is to have a phased implementation of chapter formatting:<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Hard code a single formatting style into BBeB Binder.</li>
        <li>Hard-code 2-3 formatting styles and allow the user to select different ones.</li>
        <li>We could have a HTML file that is a template for the chapter start.</li>
        <li>Move the formatting into plug-ins allowing the user to select their own.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Table of Contents Creation</h2>
    <p>
        The table of contents is obviously closely related to document chapters. They can
        often be a one-to-one mapping where each chapter has a TOC entry, and the only entries
        in the TOC are chapters. Often the TOC is a bit more detailed allowing entries to
        refer to what I'll call subchapters.</p>
    <p>
        The plan is to have a second setting for the TOC filter level. It will default to
        one level greater than the chapter filter. So If the chapter filter defaults to
        H2, then the TOC filter will default to H3. The TOC filter can be any value: less
        than, greater than, or equal to the chapter filter.</p>
    <h2>
        Table of Contents Formatting</h2>
    <p>
        Like chapters, the table of contents formatting is important.</p>
    <div align="center">
        <img border="1" src="img/toc-foundation.gif" alt="Second Foundation chapter heading" /><br />
        Exerpt from Isaac Asimov's "Second Foundation"</div>
        <p>Here's another:</p>
